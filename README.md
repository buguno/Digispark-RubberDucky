# Digispark-RubberDucky

Digispark is a development board with the ATMEL AVR ATTINY85 microcontroller, which can be plugged directly into the computer's USB and programmed using the Arduino IDE.

The intention is to use Digispark as a replacement for the Rubber Ducky which is very expensive.

> WARNING: Use the Arduino IDE in super user mode

## Pin outs

- All pins can be used as Digital I/O
- Pin 0 → I2C SDA, PWM (LED on Model B)
- Pin 1 → PWM (LED on Model A)
- Pin 2 → I2C SCK, Analog In
- Pin 3 → Analog In (also used for USB+ when USB is in use)
- Pin 4 → PWM, Analog (also used for USB- when USB is in use)
